# Description
This is the updated docker-compose repo of all the media and home server apps described in the following guides on our website:

* Docker Media Server - [https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/)
* Traefik Reverse Proxy - [https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-reverse-proxy-tutorial-for-docker/](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-reverse-proxy-tutorial-for-docker/)
* Docker with Google OAuth2 - [https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/google-oauth-with-traefik-docker/](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/google-oauth-with-traefik-docker/)

## But what about Traefik 2.0?
<p>At this point this stack is built on Traefik 1.0. As we move ours to Traefik 2.0, we will publish a new repository. </p>

<p>Having said that, Traefik 1.7.16 (the final release in v1) still works great for the purposes of a media / home server stack. Traefik 2.0 is significantly different requiring a major rework of your files. Therefore, if you are already on Traefik v1, we do not see a need to upgrade to v2 at this point. </p>

<p>If you are starting out, you may start with Traefik 2.0. However, documentation, community knowledge, and support for Traefik 2.0 is still quite limited at this time.</p>

## IPVanish VPN
Some of the containers are behind VPN for privacy and security. We have been using [IPVanish](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/go/ipvanish) for a while now. The following apps are behind IPVanish VPN:
* Jackett
* qBittorrent
* Transmission BT
* jDownloader

Based on the docker-compose blocks for the above apps, you can almost any of the apps behind VPN. 

# Usage

First, install Docker and Docker Compose, as described in our <a href="https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/">Docker Media Server guide</a>. 

1. Clone the repo.
2. Configure `traefik.toml`
  * Rename `traefik\traefik.toml.example` to `traefik\traefik.toml`
  * Edit it to reflect your situation
  * Edit domain name. 
  * DNS Challenge (for LetsEncrypt verification) is enabled by default for cloudflare. Use the [Traefik Reverse Proxy guide](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-reverse-proxy-tutorial-for-docker/) for help with this.
  * For other providers other than cloudflare, [check here](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/#providers).
3. (Optional) Enable or use HTTP Basic Authentication by renaming `shared\.htpasswd.example` to `shared\.htpasswd` in the folder and adding username and hashed password to it. 
4. Configure environmental variables (`.env` file)
  * Rename the included `.env.example` to `.env`.
  * Edit variables in `.env` file. 
  * All variables (ie. `${XXX}`) in docker-compose.yml come from `.env` file stored in the same place as docker-compose.yml. 
  * Ensure good permissions for the `.env` file (recommended: 640).
5. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to include only the services you want or add additional services to it. Be sure to read the comments for each app and create any required files.
6. Start and stop your docker stack as described in our [Docker Media Server guide](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/).
7. (Optional) Put non-docker apps behind Traefik proxy by renaming `traefik\rules\app.toml.example` to `traefik\rules\app.toml` and editing its contents.
